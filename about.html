        <h1>My About Page</h1>
        <p style="justify-content: center;">As a child, I had a variety of aspirations. In preschool, I proudly declared that I was going to be a police officer. In elementary school, my dream job developed from a police officer to a scientist, then a professional basketball player, and even a chef. But in middle school, I hadn’t settled on anything, but I did have an interest in activities that involved creativity and practicality.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t until high school that I discovered computer science. A course I took showed me how technology could streamline everyday tasks, such as helping my family navigate the challenge of deciding what to eat with our different dietary restrictions. Working with classmates, I was able to successfully create a simple app that suggested a food based on a questionnaire completed by the user. I remember watching the app work for the first time, and the joy knowing that I had solved a problem that had always been a challenge in my home. The combination of collaboration, problem-solving, and using technology to create practical solutions drew me to CS. </p>
        <p>Following this project, I became fascinated with how technology could simplify tasks and looked at how they could also solve complex problems in society. With the increasing life expectancy in the U.S., elderly care will be more essential than ever before. I aspire to develop an affordable AI robot that can provide elderly care at the same level as human caregivers.</p>
